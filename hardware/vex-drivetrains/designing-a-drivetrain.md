The performance of any drivetrain is based not only on the type selected, but also on the quality with which it is designed and built. These Vex Forum threads on [Designing a Quality Drive](https://www.vexforum.com/t/designing-a-quality-drive/81850) and [Designing Another Quality Drive](https://www.vexforum.com/t/designing-another-quality-drive/90920) are great resources for newer teams interested in maximizing their drive's performance.

* **Planning:** Set constraints for the drivetrain to best accomplish the tasks in the game (i.e. "The width must be less than 13 inches." or "There must be at least 6 inches of room on the front of the drive to attach a mechanism). By setting these constraints before designing, the processes to follow will be much easier to accomplish.
* **Designing:** CAD tools such as [those found here](broken-reference) are especially helpful when designing a drivetrain, as they allow the visualization of the drive in its final form. However, a pen and some graph paper is always acceptable alternative. Whatever the method, fully designing the drivetrain before beginning the build is very beneficial. Making sure to account for all spacing and planning is crucial to a successful design.&#x20;
* **Robustness:** Making sure that the drivetrain follows the mechanics listed in the [Best Practices](best-practices.md) article allows for a sturdy start to the robot. Assuring that a base will withstand competition as well as other loads that come with designing a robot. Robustness includes both a lack of wear and bending over time, as well as excessive wear to each individual component(wheels, motors, bearings, etc.)

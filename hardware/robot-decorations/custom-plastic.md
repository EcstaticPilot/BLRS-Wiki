# Custom Plastic

Any plastic that does not serve a function beyond decoration does not count towards the legal plastic limit. A piece is considered non functional if the performance of a robot or subsystem is not in any way altered by the removal of the piece/s. (A piece that is used to shield game elements from entering or being stuck in a portion of the robot is considered functional)

Robots may use custom-made parts cut from certain types of non-shattering plastic. It must be possible to have cut all of the plastic parts on the Robot from a single 12” x 24” sheet, up to 0.070” thick.

Plastic parts do not have to be literally cut from the same original 12” x 24” sheet. However, all individual parts must be able to “nest” or rearrange into a 12” x 24” area.&#x20;

Legal plastic (**functional or decoration**) types include polycarbonate (Lexan), acetal monopolymer (Delrin), acetal copolymer (Acetron GP), POM (acetal), ABS, PEEK, PET, HDPE, LDPE, Nylon (all grades), Polypropylene, and FEP.

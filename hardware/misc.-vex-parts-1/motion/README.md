## Washer Material

Similar to the material of metal used, different types of washers can have drastic effects on the performance of a subsystem.

| **Plastic Washer**       | **Metal Washer**           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Metal on Metal Contact   | Plastic on Plastic Contact |
| Metal on Plastic Contact | -                          |

Using plastic washers between two pieces of metal or metal and plastic helps to drastically reduce friction, and provides for a much more smooth rotation. In cases of plastic on plastic contact, metal washers provide the same benefits.

# The Interview

There are 2 main interviews that will take place at a competition. There are pit interviews where judges will come around to all of the pits and ask a team to present their team and robot to them. Some teams will then recieve a secondary interview at most competitions where there will be the same presentation again but also a question and answer section that will most likely interupt the presentation.

### Pit Interviews

Pit interviews are the less formal of the two forms as every team gets them. They usually last 3-5 minutes between matches and the goal is to get as much information to the judges as possible to qualify for awards. A good practice here is to break down each subsystem of the robot and explain key features and the design process behind it. Also have a section about programming, strategy, and team involvement (in robotics and local communities).&#x20;

#### How to Prepare

* Plan ahead for what each team member will say
  * Outline the most unique parts of your robot
  * Outline reasoning behind decisions made
  * Decide who will introduce the team and who will talk about non robot related things (team involvment, team planning, etc.)
* Think of what award the team wants to win and base this interview around that
* Think of questions that a judge could ask and plan a response
* Practice, Practice, Practice!

### Secondary Interviews

Here is the place for judges to ask more questions about the team, their process, and the robot they made. It is common for judges to ask lots of questions to really see who the best teams are and how teams are able to work together and answer complex problems. Often times, these will be more complex programming questions about what the team used or mechanical design reasoning.

#### How to Prepare

* Read the design and excellence rubrics to know what to target
* Practice with mentors and have them ask questions
* Have visuals ready or references to the engineering design notebook if applicable
* Practice showing different key features of the robot or program to appear well prepared
* Make sure to switch between speaking team members often and act as if it is a conversation over a presentation.&#x20;

Above is the rubric for the design interview. It is important to review this before planning a presentation so that all key points can be addressed. Remember that the judges are here to learn about robots, teams, and their process. Be as engaging as possible, keep a positive attitude, and practice, practice, practice.&#x20;

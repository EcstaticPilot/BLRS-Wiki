# Bearings

## Bearing Flats

The most frequently used type of bearing among competition teams, Bearing Flats are most often used on joints to ensure the axle spins smoothly without jamming against a flat face.&#x20;

Comprised of three unthreaded bores along a plastic face, Bearing Flats are most commonly secured to [C-Channels](c-channels-and-angles.md) or other [structural components](./) through the outer two bores, so as to distribute pressure on the bearing evenly across both sides. With standard VEX axles and [screws](fasteners.md) fitting perfectly through the center bore, this reduces friction in the axle by providing a smooth, consistent inner surface for free rotation.

## Pillow Block Bearings

While not quite as commonly used as Bearing Flats, Pillow Block Bearings achieve a similar function for a different use-case.

While standard Bearing Flats are mounted the the main structural component parallel to the axle of the rotation, Pillow Block Bearings are mounted in a perpendicular fashion. For example, Pillow Block Bearings would be mounted on the top of bottom of a c-channel flange, whereas a standard Bearing Flat would be mounted within the two flanges. Using a Pillow Block Bearing can help either raise or lower the main chassis structure from the ground, either raising or lowering overall ground clearance.

## High-Strength Varieties

Both Bearing Flats and Pillow Block Bearings are available in high-strength varieties. These high-strength bearings have a much larger center bore, in order to accommodate high-strength axles.

The high-strength Bearing Flats and Pillow Block Bearings do not differ in overall functionality from their standard variants, the only difference is their ability to accommodate a larger axle. These parts can be useful for high-stress environments when designing a robot, such as in high-torque gear ratios.

## Ball Bearings

Ball Bearings are an incredibly versatile option for ensuring low-friction under stress in moving parts.

While taking up more space than a standard Bearing Flat, Ball Bearings do offer unique advantages, such as consistently low friction under heavy load. Because of this, Ball Bearings are incredibly useful for high-speed mechanisms such as Flywheels, where having consistent rotation and low friction are essential.

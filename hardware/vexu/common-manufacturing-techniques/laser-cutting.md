# Laser Cutting

Laser cutting is an ideal manufacturing technique in VexU for any flat design such as gears, brackets, and more. The technique is fast, and versatile across materials allowing for quick iterations and final products that suit the designers' needs.

The process begins by designing a digital program in a CAD/CAM system that directs the laser cutter. This design file, typically a DXF or DWG file, outlines the desired shapes and dimensions of the parts to. The laser cutter, guided by the CNC system, then uses a concentrated beam of light to melt, burn, or vaporize the material along the programmed path.&#x20;

## Best Practices

**SAFETY FIRST!** Lasers are dangerous tools that can cause serious harm if not used properly. Make sure that proper PPE is used, there is supervision, and the machine is setup with proper ventilation.

### Design For The Process

Laser Cutting is very versatile, but many people lack experience with the technique and therefore fall into common traps. Firstly, avoid sharp corners (both internal & external) that would likely be rounded over when being cut. Additionally, plan joining features early for each part so they can be cut properly & reduce assembly time.&#x20;

### Prototype!

Until tolerances are refined, and experience is had, make sure to test parts & features on less expensive, easier to obtain/cut materials as to not waste time and money.

### Material Selection

<mark style="color:yellow;">Polycarbonate</mark> - This material is strong, impact-resistant, and readily accessible in most areas. One concern with Polycarbonate is its flexibility, especially since most laser cutting machines will only cut <0.25" thick Polycarbonate.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Delrin</mark> - This material has a high stiffness, low friction, good dimensional stability and is great for applications such as gears because of this. Delrin is more expensive than some more common plastics, but is still readily available on sites like Amazon.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">Aluminum</mark> - Despite needing a powerful laser to accomplish, Aluminum can be cut on a laser cutting machine making it perfect for complex structures & strong braces. Aluminum itself is lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant making it a great material for use in competitive robotics.&#x20;

# Misc. Building Techniques

## Box Bracing

Box Bracing is a form of bracing that strengthens a subsystem comprised of c-channels, reducing slop, flexibility, and bending in the aforementioned bars. Box Bracing is composed of two c-channels, facing inwards towards each other, and attached together with a long screw running between both c-channels.

![An example of Box Bracing](<../.gitbook/assets/Boxed C-Channel.PNG>)

The space between the two c-channels should be filled with spacers wherever a screw runs between the c-channels in order to prevent over-tightening, which can deform the metal. Box Bracing is often used in coordination with other bracing techniques, which can be found [here](lifts/best-practices.md).

## Custom Plastic Parts

According to the current VRC rulebook, teams are allowed a certain amount of non-shattering plastic for use on robots. As rules can change from year to year, it is recommended that you check the rules for specifications on plastic amount and type.

There are many applications of custom plastic parts in VEX, some of which include, but are not limited to:

### Plastic Gussets

Using plastic to create custom gussets or brackets can be very beneficial when constructing angles not supported by VEX parts, or when designing with odd measurements. Whether by use of CAD or tin snips, using custom gussets or brackets can often lead to a more precise, stable mounting solution.

## Connecting Gears to Wheels

Oftentimes, especially in drive trains, wheels are driven from gears, but the use of axles, or screw joints tends to allow for slop that is not wanted. To overcome this, it is a common practice to use additional bracing & hardware to attach the wheels & gears with improved rigidity in the joint.&#x20;

Vex has released new wheels which contain standard 0.5" spaced holes allowing for far easier attachment. This article portion will focus on alternative needs

Using stand-offs, it is possible to brace the core of most wheels against various gears. As shown below, 2 stand-offs act to apply torque directly to the wheel off of the face of the gear. These two points, along with the shaft itself, will reduce the slop in rotation.

Zip ties can be used, and are most commonly used with flex wheels. Making sure to evenly distribute zip ties & to overlap where possible will create the best outcome. Zip ties are not limited to only flex wheels & were a common way to reduce slop pre-V5

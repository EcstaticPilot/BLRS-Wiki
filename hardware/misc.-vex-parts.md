# Misc. Building Techniques

## Box Bracing

Box Bracing is a form of bracing that strengthens a subsystem comprised of c-channels, reducing slop, flexibility, and bending in the aforementioned bars. Box Bracing is composed of two c-channels, facing inwards towards each other, and attached together with a long screw running between both c-channels.

![An example of Box Bracing](<../.gitbook/assets/Boxed C-Channel.PNG>)

The space between the two c-channels should be filled with spacers wherever a screw runs between the c-channels in order to prevent over-tightening, which can deform the metal. Box Bracing is often used in coordination with other bracing techniques, which can be found [here](lifts/best-practices.md).

## Custom Plastic Parts

According to the current VRC rulebook, teams are allowed a certain amount of non-shattering plastic for use on robots. As rules can change from year to year, it is recommended that you check the rules for specifications on plastic amount and type.

There are many applications of custom plastic parts in VEX, some of which include, but are not limited to:

### Plastic Gussets

Using plastic to create custom gussets or brackets can be very beneficial when constructing angles not supported by VEX parts, or when designing with odd measurements. Whether by use of CAD or tin snips, using custom gussets or brackets can often lead to a more precise, stable mounting solution.

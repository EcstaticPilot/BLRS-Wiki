# RPM

RPM, or revolutions per minute, is a measure of the rotational speed of an object. It is defined as the number of complete revolutions an object makes around its axis of rotation in one minute. RPM is often used to describe the speed of mechanical systems, such as motors, gears, and shafts.

The relationship between RPM, [torque](torque.md), and the speed of a shaft is complex and depends on several factors, including the size and shape of the shaft, the type and amount of load being applied, and the efficiency of the system.

In general, the torque required to rotate a shaft increases with the speed of the shaft. This is because the faster an object rotates, the more force is required to overcome the centrifugal forces acting on it. As a result, shafts operating at high speeds typically require higher torque to maintain their rotational motion.

Conversely, the speed of a shaft is directly proportional to the torque applied to it, assuming the load and efficiency of the system remain constant. This means that increasing the torque applied to a shaft will result in an increase in its speed, and decreasing the torque will result in a decrease in its speed.

The RPM and torque of a shaft are important factors to consider in the design and operation of mechanical systems. Engineers must carefully balance these variables to ensure that the system operates efficiently and safely and that the shaft is able to withstand the forces acting on it.

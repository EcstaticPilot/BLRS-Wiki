Catapults operate on very similar principles as [linear punchers](linear-puncher.md), but with rotational movement instead of linear. An example system can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umryvVdB7sg).

The example shown above uses nautilus gears, but it is also quite easy to use shaved gears (slipgears) like on the linear puncher. Obviously with a catapult, normal gears would be used alongside the shaved pinion instead of rack gears.

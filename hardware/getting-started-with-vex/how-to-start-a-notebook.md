  One of the most important aspects of a Vex team is its notebook. This is the
  best way for a team to stay organized, stay on track, and document everything
  they do throughout the season.

# How to Start a Notebook

{% hint style="info" %}
These notebook photos are from 91A Vexmen Archangel's 2020-21 competition notebook. This team competes in Eastern Pennsylvania and won Tournament Champion, Skills Finalist, and the Excellence Award. This article was written by a member of the team who is now on BLRS. If you have more questions, reach out on discord (@Max|BLRS|91A on VTOW)

It should be noted that this is not a perfect notebook but is a good start. For more information, refer to the current season's rubric for a better understanding of expectations.&#x20;

## Parts of a Notebook

### Table of Contents

There is not much to say here. This is where you will document the outline of your notebook with specific page numbers (and page ranges) referenced. The biggest tip, leave enough space. How specific you are depending on how much effort you want to put in but more specifics never hurts. Highlight special entries, and color code as you see fit.&#x20;

### The Team

Here is where the team is introduced and other work from the team is shared. Start out with a photo of the whole team together (if possible) with a brief introduction. Then have individual bios of each team member as well as a professional photo. Talk about their grade, how long they have done vex, other interests, and goals for the season. At the end of this section, talk about team goals, as well as other projects the team works on. For example, mentoring other teams, volunteering together. BLRS for example talks about this Wiki.

### Design Process to Follow (Overall Organization)

Here is where [the design process](the-design-process.md) needs to be broken down. Below is a sample from the Engineering Design Process thread, and one from the International Baccalaureate Program. You can see that one is very specific, and one is very general. It is key that each step is broken down so that the team knows how to follow it, and the judges know what to expect.

### The Problem

Here is where the game and overall design problem is analyzed. Add photos, measurements, and more to make sure there is lots of detail. The biggest issue here is to just repeat the rules instead of analyzing them. This is the basis for the rest of the notebook so make sure to go in depth and study every facet of the game.&#x20;

![2020-21 Design Award Rubric](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-12-31 at 9.40.42 AM.png>)

Above is a portion of the design award rubric to guide notebook creation. This portion of the notebook is the first section of the rubric and is the basis for showing a team's understanding of the problem at hand. During the judging process, it is common for judges to pass over some notebooks in order to save time. This is the first section that a judge will see and if it is not strong, the rest of the notebook may be passed over.&#x20;

### Brainstorming

Here, ideas are generated in order to solve the problem that was just analyzed. When doing this, it is best to break the robot into different subsystems. Think Drive (how it will traverse the field), Manipulator (how it will interact with game elements), and scoring mechanisms (how it will get game elements into scoring zones). After you break apart the robot, create 3-5 (or more) ideas for each of the subsystems. Draw sketches, annotate ideas and take photos of mock-ups or other robots for inspiration. Anything goes here, just make sure that the process can be followed.

![2020-21 Design Award Rubric](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-12-31 at 9.40.51 AM.png>)

Above is another portion of the design rubric notebook. This portion of the notebook (and design process) will be what the rest of a team's design is based on. It is important to generate several ideas to not only satisfy the rubric but also to make sure all of the possibilities for design are considered.&#x20;

#### Selecting Approach

After several ideas have been generated, select one annotated sketch for each idea and as a team, discuss the attributes of the idea. This can be done however the team sees fit but two suggestions are to use either pros/cons lists or weighted decision matrices. Use discussions and testing in order to decide on an approach to continue with.&#x20;

![2020-21 Design Award Rubric](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-12-31 at 9.41.04 AM.png>)

After generating ideas, it is important to show the difference in ideas and their perceived ability to succeed as a design. The portion of the rubric above asks for reasoning on the decision and also the plan for implementation. This means that designs should be discussed individually as well as part of a whole system. Here is an opportunity to begin planning out the whole robot and describe future plans.&#x20;

#### Project Management

Take some time before regular meetings to outline a schedule and outline how the team will stay on track throughout the season. Start with outlining meeting times, and weekly hours to put in. Then outline a schedule for the season including competitions, scrimmages, and time you need to complete parts of the robot (building, testing, programming, driving practice). Try using GANTT charts or month view schedules to show goals and timelines. Keep it all realistic, and add additional updates to the goals and schedules as it seems necessary (monthly or after each competition is recommended).&#x20;

#### Daily Logs

Here is the place to document progress on the robot and to show testing and evaluations. Begin each entry with the goals for the meeting, a basic timeline of what you want to accomplish, and everyone who attended the meeting. Add lots of annotated photos, any testing that occurs, and an analysis of the progress. End each entry with what was accomplished, and what should be accomplished by the next meeting. This does not need to be a full team report every time. If one person does something on their own, make sure it is logged. &#x20;

![2020-21 Design Award Rubric](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-12-31 at 9.41.19 AM.png>)

This is the meat of the notebook and also as the rubric. It becomes very cyclical as the design process often is. It is important to be thorough throughout this whole portion so that a judge can understand the process taken and also so that the team can reflect on testing to further future designs.&#x20;

#### Programming Logs

Here is a place to document all of the progress on programming for the team. It is important to show the process that was followed and shows that all code was developed by the team (or reference outside resources (Okapi, PROS, Pilons' Odometry Document, etc.). It is recommended that the team heavily annotates all code in the notebook so that judges with little to no experience can understand it, and more experienced judges can better appreciate it.&#x20;

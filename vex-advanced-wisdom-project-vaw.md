# Mission Statement

Purdue SIGBots Wiki works to provide VEX Robotics competitors at all skill levels with a wealth of community-driven knowledge that has been developed over a rich history of BLRS competition and work within the community. We also envision a place for students to share what they have learned, and host a location for learning to begin, and grow.&#x20;

#### How are we achieving this goal?

With this Wiki, we seek to centralize the wealth of information between generations of robotics students in one location. Many of these articles have been passed down in the Purdue SIGBots internal documents and have been updated for public usage.&#x20;

By making this project open-sourced, we can help expand this knowledge base with diverse viewpoints and sources. For more information on how you can help, check out our [contributing guidelines page](contributing-guidelines/).

The VEX community is one that is better together, we believe that the increased sharing of knowledge that is accessible to every team will bring about better robots and, most importantly, better engineers.

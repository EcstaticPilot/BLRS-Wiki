# Volunteering At Local Events

As a VexU team, volunteering at local VRC events does 2 things. Firstly, it allows you to learn a lot about how competitions work, hoa the judging process works, and gives hands on experience with the game since VexU teams compete less. Secondly, RECF has made it so that VexU teams are able to compete in the Robot Skills Challenge at VRC events allowing their score to be updated on the global standings. This makes it possible for teams to improve their skills score and qualify for the world championship without traveling to a VexU competition.&#x20;

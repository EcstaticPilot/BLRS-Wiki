To connect a mobile device, the device must be running the TM Mobile app (Available on iOS and Android) as well as being on the same network as the computer running the TM server. On the mobile device, a pop up will occur giving a code or the option to change settings. By default, the average user does not need to change settings (although it may need to change the Server IP (given by TM computer) if it has been used at a prior competition). To open the Mobile Devices tool on the hosting computer, go to `Tools > Mobile Devices.` Type the Code displayed on the mobile device, and fill in the inputs as necessary.

# Inputting Match Scores

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Submitting Match Score.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Scoring Tab</p></figcaption></figure>

This is the main page for scoring each match (outside of TM Mobile). It is auto populated with scores submitted on the TM Mobile App but must be confirmed here. It varies based on the game but the main functions are the same. The 4 main functions are `Save Scores`, `Reset Scores`, `Unscore Match`, `View Score History`. They are all self explanatory and will vary the indicator circle next to the match.&#x20;

To control a match, select `Field Set Control` -> `Desired Field Set` which will open the below dialogue box.&#x20;

The first things to notice are the `Match On Field` (with option to `Queue Next Match`), and `Match Timer`. The main inputs in this display are **`Field`** (auto populated based on schedule), **`Audience Display`** (Automatically Intro when a match is queued, and swithces to In-Match when the match is started), **`Autonomous Winner`** (Displays during match but is finalized in scoring), and most importantly **`Start Match`**, **`End Early`**, **`Reset Timer`** (Abort Match is shown once a match is started).&#x20;

The other options will allow you to give and display a `Time-out` for a team and toggle whether the computer running the TM server will play `Sound Effects`_._

# Inputting Scores on TM Mobile

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Mobile Device Scoring.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>TM Mobile Scoring</p></figcaption></figure>

Start by selecting a match to score on the left screen, and the middle screen will open. This is similar to the desktop version but can be used for live scoring. The bottom 3 buttons are used to delete the score, refresh the score (if 2+ devices are being used) and to save the score.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If 2 mobile devices are used to score the same match, the last device to save the score is the published one. Either confirm they are identical or only save on one.
{% endhint %}

Skills matches are scored similarly to the desktop version as well, with a team selection similar to the left screen, and runs saved with scores on the right screen. Teams normally run roughly 3 of each type of skills run however TM will not limit the total number, only notify that the team has run the allotted number.

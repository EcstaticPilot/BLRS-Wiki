# Competition Electronics

There are two key electronics sold by Vex to support field control and competitions:

The Match Controller is used to interface between a computer running Tournament Manager and the competition field. One is needed for each field and should be placed alongside the field. The Driver Interface is used to connect teams to the field setup. The teams connect their V5 controllers to the VEXnet port. The 2 match controllers at each field (one for each alliance) are connected to the Match Controller through CAT5 cables.&#x20;

Above is an example field setup for a small competition. It is physically very straight forward when at a small scale. The lines above represent the only cable that are required to run the match. This however does not show any displays for the competitors and audience, as well as other fields including skills fields. Much of this requires a network to be setup instead of running display cables directly from the main computer.

# V5 ESD Protection Board

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note to anybody potentially buying this board: We've noticed that there is an issue with the board where the holes aren't the correct size for the RJ11 jack. The SIGBots electronics team is currently making a new PCB design for the board to fit the jack properly.
{% endhint %}

This is an ESD protection board for the V5 Brain to help prevent dead ports or dead motors. **This solution is not competition legal but can be very easily removed before a competition.** This board sits in-between a port on the [brain](./) and a [motor](../motors.md). Technical information about RS-485 Bus Protection can be seen here:

## Installation

![1. The first step should be to install the TVS Diode, which should be soldered onto the D1 pads.](../../../.gitbook/assets/9074734a21e9afba09e6ca821b47d0df%20%282%29.png)

![2. The second and final step should be to drop in and solder jacks into the J1 and J2 Section of the board. ](../../../.gitbook/assets/9074734a21e9afba09e6ca821b47d0df.png)

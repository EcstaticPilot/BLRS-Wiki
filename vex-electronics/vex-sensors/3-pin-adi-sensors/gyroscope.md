The **VEX Yaw-Rate Gyro**, or simply the **VEX Gyro**, is an analog gyroscope which returns a voltage between 0 and +5 V approximately proportional to the **rate** of rotation around the vertical axis through the sensor. The full-scale range is about +/- 1000 degrees per second, a huge limit that compresses the full-scale range and reduces resolution. While acceptable for coarse positioning, use of a digital gyroscope leads to more precise readings.

The VEX Gyro is highly vulnerable to [Line Noise](../../../electronics/general/line-noise.md) and should be shielded or placed far from [motors](../../vex-electronics/motors.md). All gyroscopes must be placed at the robot's center of rotation for optimal results. Dynamic calibration is therefore a must before each run.

# Vision Sensor

![V5 Vision Sensor](../../../.gitbook/assets/visionsensor.jpg)

## Features

At its most basic mode, the sensor tells you where a colored object is located. The location's X value gives you the right and left position. When the camera is tilted down, the Y value gives you the distance to the object, with a little basic trigonometry on your part.

The Vision Sensor combines a dual ARM Cortex M4+M0 processor, color camera, WiFi, and USB into a single sensor. The sensor can be trained to locate objects by color. Every 200 milliseconds, the camera provides a list of the object found matching up to eight unique colors. The object’s height, width, and location is provided. Multi-colored objects can also be programmed, allowing color codes to provide new information to the robot. Color-codes can represent anything you want, including location, object type, street signs, movement instructions, robot identifiers, etc. The Vision Sensor has USB for a direct connection to your computer. The Vision Sensor also has WiFi Direct and acts like a web server. This allows you to wirelessly view “live” video from any computer equipped with a browser and WiFi.

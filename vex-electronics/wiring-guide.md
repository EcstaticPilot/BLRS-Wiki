# V5 Brain Wiring Guide

## Wiring Basics

The V5 brain has 3 different types of ports - 20 motor ports (labeled ports 1-21), a single radio port (port 21), and 8 3-pin analog sensor ports (labeled ports A-H). These analog ports support 3-pin cortex-era sensors and (although not competition legal) 393 3-pin motors.

Wiring from sensors/motors to brain ports is relatively simple compared to the legacy cortex system. Here's some tips when doing so -

* Keep wires tight around robot arms to prevent loose wires getting snagged on other robots or other subsystems.&#x20;
  * Also, try to keep loose wires or wiring away from joints to prevent wires from being crushed by them.
  * Zip/Cable ties are a good option for keeping wires organized.
* Wire lengths should be based on the maximum length that it needs to prevent wires from being stretched out by the robot itself.
  * You can do this by putting your robot to its full length before wiring.
* Labeling wires with their port numbers helps to keep wires organized in the case they need to replaced or moved around.&#x20;

Also, be sure that your robot has enough room so that the V5 brain screen and button are easily accessible and visible. The battery should be in a firm spot that is easy to remove and replace in competition environments.

## Wire Crimping

Wire crimping allows teams to produce custom wire lengths and replace broken wires or wire heads. However, they can be to blame for dead ports if done incorrectly.

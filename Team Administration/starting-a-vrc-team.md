# Starting a VRC Team

The aim of this article is to discuss and elaborate on the necessary components of starting a VEX Robotics team, from the finances and commitments involved to the organization of a team or teams. In addition to describing what is necessary to start a VRC team or teams, this article describes various ways funding for your organization can be acquired.

## Gaining Interest for your Teams

A team, first and foremost, is successful due to the members that contribute to its success. The first step towards creating a VRC team should be generating interest towards creating or joining a VRC team. Regardless of organization or team size, gathering team members is a very important step.

### Club Fairs

Club fairs are great opportunities to recruit new members, as the presence of so many different organizations in one place will draw the attention of students from all across campus. Different universities have different ways of doing things, but many will have a large club fair at the beginning of each fall and spring term. Creating a poster and sitting at a table for a few hours may seem silly and pointless, but it's likely to create more interest in the team, especially if whoever is at the table is knowledgeable about VEX and is willing to answer any questions that potential recruits might have.&#x20;

### Advertisements

An important part of gaining interest is to advertise; no one can join a team they don’t know exists. Putting up fliers around campus is always a good way to go, but creating a website, social media, and/or a Discord server can also help. In these advertisements, it’s a good idea to include things such as contact information, server or group chat links, and the time and location of any planned callout meetings. That said, if any contact information is included, it is important to be prepared to respond to questions or comments that may be sent. Lack of communication is a good way to _not_ gain interest for a team.

### Showcase a Robot

Robots are pretty darn cool, so showcasing a robot at an event is always a good way to attract attention, especially in a place where people are likely to walk by. If the team is going to a club fair anyway, bringing a bot to showcase (especially if it works) is a good tool to grab people’s interest. Every table around campus and at fairs will have a tri-fold poster and some fliers, but very few - if any - will have an actual, functional robot. Having a robot not only makes it clear what the team does, but it shows that the team, or at least someone on it, already has some experience with VEX.

## Creating your Teams

After gathering a base of team members, establishing the team or teams in an organization is an important next step. In addition to registering the team on RobotEvents, deciding how many teams are necessary, as well as discussing team roles should be prioritized as well.

### Deciding How Many Teams

There are many factors that come into play when deciding how many teams to create, including, but not limited to:

#### Available Team Members

One important thing to consider is the number of participants that will be participating on a VEX Robotics team. While team sizes can range from one to upwards of ten members, having too many or too few members per team can make progress inefficient with regards to creating a functional robot. More information on an effective team size can be found in the [Member Allocation and Management](starting-a-vrc-team.md#member-allocation-and-management) segment of this article.&#x20;

#### Budget

When deciding whether or not to create additional teams within your organization, it is important to determine whether or not an additional team will factor into the budget. When starting a new team, or multiple teams at once, you are effectively doubling your startup costs with additional parts and logistical fees, among other things, that will have to be purchased. For more information on organizing a budget for your teams, please see the [Financial Breakdown](starting-a-vrc-team.md#one-year-team-financial-breakdown) segment of this document.

#### Logistics

In addition to having the manpower and budget to create an additional team, the logistics of competing with more than one team must be taken into account as well. Hosting teams will require some place for these teams to work, whether this is just a desk, or a full field setup. While a full field can be shared by numerous teams, it is beneficial to take spatial concerns into account when deciding how many teams to create. In addition, transportation to competitions must be factored in as well, whether this is a school-sponsored bus, or independent transportation on behalf of the team members.&#x20;

In addition to the above, organizing your members into effective teams is essential. For more information on Member Allocation and Management, please see [here](starting-a-vrc-team.md#member-allocation-and-management).

### Registering your Teams

Registering a team, in an VEX Robotics competition, can be done on [RobotEvents](https://www.robotevents.com/register/teams). When registering teams through RobotEvents, you will be asked to choose a team number, among other important information, as well as letters for each team. Your team number will be consistent across every team you register in a given competition, and the letter will be the differing indicator for each team (94999E and 94999X, or BLRS and BLRS2).

## One-Year Team Financial Breakdown

To help with budgeting for VRC teams, the following spreadsheet and breakdown record the finances of team 94999E through the 2020-2021 season, Change Up. As team 94999E was independent from a school or organization, this financial breakdown includes the start up costs that would be applicable to a new VRC team, as well as other expenses accumulated throughout the season.

### Cost Spreadsheet

### Financial Breakdown

#### VEX Parts

At 43.81% of the total cost throughout the season, purchasing VEX parts was the highest singular expense incurred when purchasing as a first year team. This high cost is mainly determined by the fact that a new team will need to purchase the total parts to build at least one full robot, rather than being able to build off of an existing supply. For teams that already have parts accumulated that are not being otherwise used, this cost should decrease by a notable amount.

Notable parts that were purchased include:

* V5 Competition Super Kit
* Two Additional Motors and One Extra Battery
* Various Sensors
* Additional Aluminum and Steel Structural Parts
* More Wheel Types
* Additional Gears and Sprockets
* Misc. Other Parts

While the listed parts do not cover the full cost of VEX Parts listed on the spreadsheet, they are the most notable costs that will need to be covered for a new team.

#### VEX Game/Field Elements

This expenditure consists of both game element kits, as well as the field element kit for the 2020-2021 season. It should be noted that the cost reflected on the spreadsheet does not include field perimeter and control items, as team 94999E did not use the field for hosting competitions, and was able to borrow the perimeters when necessary.&#x20;

These kits, while very beneficial for testing robot functions, are not strictly necessary to compete, as VEX offers a guide, [DIY Field Instructions](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/competition/vrc-current-game?q=\&locale.name=English), to make custom variations of each kit. In addition, the dimensions of each game and field element are provided in the Field Specifications Appendix of the Game Manual, so a robot can be built without these kits if necessary. While this cost is a non-essential one, having the game and field element kits to practice and test with are very beneficial to a team's performance, if the budget permits.

#### Tournament Registrations

This cost is highly variable, as the total cost for Tournament Registrations is highly variable dependent on the team's location and the amount of tournaments attended. In the 2020-2021 season, team 94999E registered for six in-person competitions and five live remote competitions, not including the State and World Championships.

**In-Person Competitions**

As In-Person Competitions are the bulk of what most teams will be attending throughout the season, this portion of the total registration cost should be the larger percentage. It should be noted that average tournament registration fees will vary depending on the region, so it is worth checking a region's RobotEvents page to get a better idea of the average price to register for tournaments.

For reference, team 94999E spent $580 of the $740 total cost for Tournament Registrations on In-Person tournaments.

**Live Remote Tournaments**

As recorded by team 94999E, this percentage is a bit of an outlier, namely due to the prevalence of Live Remote Tournaments being hosted in favor of In-Person Competitions due to circumstances of the season. It should be noted that costs to register for Live Remote Tournaments are generally lower than that of registering for In-Person Competitions, in addition to eliminating travel costs. Out of the total 11 events, both remote and in-person, and $740 spent to register, team 94999E spent $160 to register for five Live Remote Tournaments.

#### Championship Registrations

The registration fees for Regional and World Championships, as noted in the Cost Breakdown Spreadsheet, are comparatively much higher than those of local tournaments. While not every team will qualify for these events, it is better to have the money allocated in the event of a qualification. As with standard local tournaments, the price of these will very from region to region, as well as between seasons. It should be noted that the World Championship registration fee noted on the spreadsheet is an outlier, as the registration fee was lowered for the Change Up season. The fee has since been increased to $1200.

Signature Events are a multi-region format of tournament that qualify teams directly to the World Championship. It should be noted that these events are typically priced in the range of Championship Events, rather than local tournaments, in addition to typically being run as multi-day events causing a raise in travel costs.

#### Transportation, Lodging, and Food

As listed on the spreadsheet, this was the single largest expenditure category for team 94999E in the Change Up season outside of parts, totaling to 25.35% of the total. The relatively high number presented can be attributed mainly to the majority of competitions attended being out of state, requiring overnight stays in hotels, in addition to gas spent when driving the longer distances. For reference, of the six In-Person Competitions registered for, four were out of state tournaments due to the circumstances of the season.&#x20;

#### Tools, Marketing Material, and Team Registration

The budget allocated for tools, in 94999E's case, was largely comprised of one time costs purchasing various necessary tools. Although the price of each tool was not recorded, the tools were generally inexpensive models purchased from a local hardware store:

* Various T15 and T10 screwdrivers
* Vice Grip
* Dremel
* Heat Gun
* Sheet Metal Sheers
* Safety Glasses

Realistically the most inessential expenditure on this spreadsheet, marketing material consisted of printing stickers of the team logo, as well as shipping costs to mail stickers, in addition to team shirts in the case of team 94999E. While this cost is not essential and can be eliminated if necessary, having team shirts and a marketable brand is very beneficial towards growing the team.

The standard fee for registering a VRC team is $150 through RobotEvents, though this cost decreases to $50 for each subsequent team registered in an organization. For instance, team 94999E, the first team registered, would cost $150, while teams 94999X, 94999Y, and 94999Z would cost $50 each to register. This cost is annual, as team registrations need to be renewed on a season-by-season basis.

## Funding your Teams

As robotics is an expensive club to run, as shown by the financial breakdown above, sources can be gathered to help fund your organization.&#x20;

### School or Organization Funding

The most direct way to receive funding for your team is through a parent organization, such as a school or umbrella organization. When forming your team or teams, it is important to reach out to school or organization administration, to inquire about the status of club and team funding.

### Member Dues

Collecting member dues is another way to raise funds from within your team. Charging a set amount for each team member to join very likely will not cover the full cost of running a VRC team, but can provide a smaller cushion to help with various costs. Especially among larger teams, where the dues can be a smaller amount paid by more members, member dues can add up to enough to help eliminate expenses.

### Sponsors

One external source of funding can be acquired by reaching out to companies and individuals90

### Scholarships and Grants



### Hosting Competitions



## Organization Structure and Longevity

A successful robotics club is an investment that will teach members various important skills in engineering, as well as in many other fields. In addition to teams learning from external resources, being able to learn from other teams and members within the organization is a system that can help your organization successfully teach new members through generations of teams.

### Engineering Notebooks

Not only do engineering notebooks provide documentation of your robot and [design process](team-documentation/the-design-process.md) for judges at competitions, they also serve as knowledge bases for future teams in your organization. Well thought-out and thorough notebooks can serve as a database for building techniques, game strategies, and programming solutions for other teams in your organization long after you've graduated. On top of the content within the notebook, the notebook itself can act as an example of how to layout and format a notebook, to continue the cycle.

### In-House Resources



### Interaction Between Teams

Mentorship between the more experienced teams in an organization and the less experienced teams is one of the most effective ways to ensure long-term competitiveness of the club. If all of the knowledge on how to be a successful team rests in a single team in the organization, the organization will struggle when that team graduates. However, even after graduation, there are still plenty of opportunities for graduated members to continue to help their VRC organization. Staying in contact with teams using communication platforms such as group chats and Discord are great ways to continually receive build advice and programming help while alumni aren't able to help in-person.

To take mentorship to the next level as a VRC team, working alongside other teams in your organization can help develop multiple competitive teams at the same time. This has many benefits, such as mutual improvement of each team, better drive practice (viable 1v1's and practice matches), and the ability to coordinate alliance selections. Many top-tier organizations have employed this strategy throughout many seasons with great success, such as [169 ](https://youtu.be/Wm7X3IUz6ok)and [8059](https://youtu.be/NX6mLf8iO34).

## Member Allocation and Management

Often overlooked, member allocation and management structure is something that can make or break a team, and may determine how much fun and experience members of a team will gain.

### Optimal Team Size

{% hint style="info" %}
This section talks mostly about a high school or middle school VRC team. VEXU team sizes can range wildly from a couple to 50 people depending on their objectives and should be evaluated on a case to case basis.
{% endhint %}

Optimal team size for a high school VRC team is 4-6 people. This allows at least 1-2 people working on software and mechanical aspects at a time. This begs the question, why not more?

The issue with team sizes such as 8 as common in larger organizations, is that there tends to be too many people with not enough things to do (too many chefs in the kitchen). This becomes an even larger issue when evaluating a team based on the design award rubric, which directly contributes to the design award and excellent award.

![Team Management Related Criteria, Interview Section](<../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)

With these sections requiring that teams have **"All students answer questions independently"**, and that **"students were assigned to tasks based on their skills and availability"**, this becomes much harder to explain and show if there simply are not enough tasks at all times for all students to do.&#x20;

This idea is very much related to the [Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp), which describes the addition of each additional unit (team member in this case), continuously having a decreasing usefulness to the team, until that usefulness becomes negative and is detrimental to the team. Click the link embedded above for more information.&#x20;

### Team Leads

Team leads are somewhat of a controversial subject in robotics teams, as they have the potential to cause a large amount of strife within a team. **Because of this, we cannot recommend team leads on the team level as team leaders tend to dominate team decisions unless the team lead(s) is the only competent person on the team with experience** (which is also subjective at best).&#x20;

However, if a team does require a lead (such as in the case above), the best way to do leadership is from a **bottom-up** approach where the team as a whole talks through decisions and the lead is there to drive that conversation, as opposed to a traditional top-down leadership structure where the team lead is the final say in everything and their opinion reigns supreme.&#x20;

**At the end of the day,** [**the engineering design**](team-documentation/the-design-process.md) **process must be the driving force behind the teamwork, not the leader themselves.**&#x20;

(Definitely easier said than done)

### Team Roles

{% hint style="info" %}
None of these roles should not be used to restrict people into specific responsibilities or allow the ideas of one role override another, but rather be used as general labels to better figure out how to organize information about the team during interviews and divide work up. With this in mind, multiple people can share one role.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Technical Roles (Mechanics, Programmers, etc.):**&#x20;

Technical roles are relatively self explanatory. The main two being mechanical engineers who are responsible for building the robots, maintenance, and coordinating with the software engineers who are responsible for figuring out where sensors need to be mounted and programming both the drive code and autonomous.&#x20;

Since the programming and building of a robot may happen at different times, the same group of people may be used for different roles during each phase of the build process. It should also be noted that all members (whether they are on software and mechanical) should be involved on the _entire_ design process.&#x20;

Some other roles may exist such as electrical engineers, who are there to prevent [ESD](../vex-electronics/v5-esd-protection-board.md), maintain wiring, or even mechanical maintenance on the robot. This could be done by members only interested in either programming or building, during the phase where they may not have as many responsibilities.&#x20;

**Support Roles (Notebookers, Drivers, etc.):**

Similarly to the electrical role mentioned above, these roles can be done by members with less technical responsibilities or during their downtime. Notebookers are a must have throughout the build process and programming process, and are best done by the ones building and programming at the time. However, if properly explained to others, people who aren't directly programming or building are able to also notebook as well.

Driver roles are somewhat of a controversial topic as well, as different members all may want this role. There is no set in stone solution to figuring out who should drive, but professionalism and the lack of personal emotion with regards to the team's decision process is key to keeping a team dynamic together. The best people to do this are the ones who both have the most amount of down time during the programming phase for the robot, and come and stay for meetings the most since this will give them the maximum amount of time to drive.&#x20;

### Summary

Member allocation and management is something that does not have a cookie cutter solution for each situation. It must be adaptable depending on various factors surrounding a team, such as level of experience and number of members among others. The only thing for certain is that establishing a working system for a robotics team that is both flexible and appropriate for the situation as early as possible is key for a team's success.

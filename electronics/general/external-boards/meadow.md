## Specifications

The [**Meadow F7 Micro**](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/collections/frontpage/products/meadow-f7) features the same footprint as the [Arduino](arduino.md) platform, so many existing [shields](http://www.shieldlist.org) providing prepackaged functionality are readily available. The Wilderness Labs Meadow F7 Micro Development Kit is based on the [STM32F7 microcontroller](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f7-series.html). This development kit comes with WiFi®, BLUETOOTH® Low Energy (BLE), integrated battery charger, 216MHz, and 16MB RAM. The Meadow F7 micro development kit incorporates 32MB flash, 2D graphics, and JPEG acceleration. This development kit includes a breadboard that helps to start building projects out of the box. The Meadow F7 micro development kit employs [GPIO](../gpio.md), PWM, [I2C](../i2c.md), [SPI](../spi.md), CAN, and [UART](../uart.md) interfaces.

## Features

* WiFi and BLE included

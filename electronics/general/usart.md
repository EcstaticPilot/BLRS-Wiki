# USART

## Usage

USART peripherals typically have a register setting which can select either synchronous ([SPI](spi.md)) or asynchronous ([UART](uart.md)) mode. This makes these peripherals very flexible. However, switching back and forth between the two is not recommended, due to initialization timing glitches which may confuse connected devices.

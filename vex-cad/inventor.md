# Inventor

## [Latest Release: 1.4.0](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest)

This library includes every length of metal, commonly used cut metal, construction circles for ease of constraining, and parametric hardware.

Library 1.4 is a large update with a lot of new parts, a lot of fixed textures, and a new set of metals structure that fixes the inaccuracies with the published Vex parts. There are also some naming inconsistencies that are fixed. As well as quality-of-life fixes for pneumatics, hinges, chain generation, and for rendering. It is **NOT** compatible with previous versions

### [Parts Library Download](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest)

The recommended file structure is to have a CAD folder anywhere on your computer and place the [latest release](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest) in this folder. Every new robot you create will be a new folder in the CAD folder.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is often helpful to use Github Desktop (Or Another Git Client) to download the library. Downloading a .Zip has lead to missing parts or corrupted files.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

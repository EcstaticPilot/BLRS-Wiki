# OnShape

OnShape is a cloud-based CAD program created to provide collaborative and accessible design capabilities, eliminating the need for traditional software installations and hardware limitations. It allows multiple users to work on the same design simultaneously, making it ideal for team-based projects and remote collaboration. OnShape is best used for real-time collaboration, streamlined workflow, and easy access to design files from any device with an internet connection.

OnShape does not require any software to be installed to a computer making it a great option for Schools & students without access to individual personal computers.&#x20;

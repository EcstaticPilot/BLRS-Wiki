# CAD Programs

Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a technology used for creating precise digital models and technical drawings of physical objects, allowing for detailed visualization and modification. In competitive robotics, students use CAD to design and prototype robot components, ensuring accuracy and functionality before physical fabrication. This enables efficient testing, optimization, and collaboration within the team, leading to more innovative and reliable robotic solutions.

In the Vex Robotics community, there are 5 major programs that students tend to choose to use. They each have their own strengths, benefits, and shortcomings. Most of the programs are also used outside of the context of Vex as well (Protobot is not).&#x20;

### Inventor

Autodesk Inventor is a very powerful program that is actively used by professionals in industry allowing for skills developed for Vex to be applied later on. Inventor has a robust set of tools that allow for almost any functionality desired for Vex Robotics design. Inventor is a great choice for Vex students due to its ease of assembly & application of industry tools. Inventor's biggest weakness is being Windows only, and needing local file storage.

### Fusion 360

Autodesk Fusion 360 is a cloud centered alternative to Inventor. With much of the same functionality, alongside some additional tools, Fusion 360 makes it easier for teams to collaborate & share files across projects. Fusion 360 is also cross platform making it accessible regardless of the computer that is being used.&#x20;

### Solidworks

Solidworks is by far the most commonly used of the listed programs when it comes to industry. This is because of the high skill ceiling and numerous tools that're featured in Solidworks. That being said, it thereby has the hardest learning curve and can be quite overwhelming to new users. It is not recommended as a first CAD program, but can be picked up once core skills are understood in other programs.&#x20;

### OnShape

OnShape is a relatively new CAD program that was created by some original developers of Solidworks in order to bring CAD to the masses. This is a browser based tool that operates very similar to other programs, but fully within a web browser like Chrome, Safari, or Edge. Onshape has a core set of tools that is all is needed for Vex, but the library that is setup by OnShape is updated infrequently and can be difficult to get started with.&#x20;

### Protobot

Protobot is designed specifically for use in Vex Robotics. It is thereby the easiest to get started with & is refined for the specific use-case. The available tools are limited to those deemed necessary for Vex, but the parts library is by far the easiest to use & get started with as it is built into the program.&#x20;

# Spacer Boxing

When screwing a brace on a chassis, you can spacer box the connection to make it stronger.  This isn't always needed, but it will add a little more strength to the base. 

## Constraining Spacer Box

We already have a spacer box on this chassis.  Instead of searching through the library to find the 0.5 and 0.375 spacer, we are going to copy/paste the already used spacer stack.

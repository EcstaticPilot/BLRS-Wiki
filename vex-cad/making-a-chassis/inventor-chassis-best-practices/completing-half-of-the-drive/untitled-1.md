# Powered Gear

## First Gear

For the powered gear, we will use a low strength 36t gear.  This will be constrained with one insert constraint with an offset of `0.1875"`.&#x20;

## Second Gear

The second gear will be constrained the same way as the wheel.  Two constraints, one mate and one flush.&#x20;

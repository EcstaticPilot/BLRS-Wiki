Reference the inventor basics bearing flat tutorial if you need more clarity.

## Constraining Bearings

Using insert constraints, we will constrain six bearings.  Four for the wheels and two for the powered axel

Some teams say you need bearings on the same channel as the motor, some teams say you don't.  In the end, you should do your own testing and come to a conclusion on your own.  Your robot won't break either way :)

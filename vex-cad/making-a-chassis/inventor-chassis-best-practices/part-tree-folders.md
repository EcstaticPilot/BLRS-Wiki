# Model Browser Folders

The model browser on the left of our screen is filled with parts.  We can put folders here to make it easier to know what parts go where.  It's important we do this before we mirror the drive so it's clear what is the left and what is the right.&#x20;

## Creating the Folder

Start by right clicking in the model browser, and selecting `Create New Folder`.  Call this folder `Left`.&#x20;

![Create New Folder](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

Highlight all of the parts on this side of the drive, like we did in the Mirror tutorial.&#x20;

![Drag Selecting Half the Drive](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (209).png>)

After selecting the drive, drag the parts in the model browser to the `Left` folder.

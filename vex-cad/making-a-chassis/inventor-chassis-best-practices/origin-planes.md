# Origin Planes

In every component and assembly, there are planes and axis around the origin point, \(0,0\) in our workspace.  We can find them under the `Origin` folder in our model browser.  By selecting them and pressing `alt+v` on our keyboards, we can make them visible. 

These can be constrained to.  Constraining to the origin planes makes sure our assemblies will be on \(0, 0\).

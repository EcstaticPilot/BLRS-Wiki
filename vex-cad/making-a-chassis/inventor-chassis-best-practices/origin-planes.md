# Origin Planes

In every component and assembly, there are planes and axis around the origin point, (0,0) in our workspace.  We can find them under the `Origin` folder in our model browser.  By selecting them and pressing `alt+v` on our keyboards, we can make them visible.&#x20;

These can be constrained to.  Constraining to the origin planes makes sure our assemblies will be on (0, 0).

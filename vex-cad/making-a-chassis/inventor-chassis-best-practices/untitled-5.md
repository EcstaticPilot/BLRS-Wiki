# Model Browser Folder (Right)

Please follow the Model Browser Folders tutorial linked below.  Instead of naming the new folder `Left`, name it `Right` and highlight the other side of the drive. 

{% content-ref url="part-tree-folders.md" %}
[part-tree-folders.md](part-tree-folders.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

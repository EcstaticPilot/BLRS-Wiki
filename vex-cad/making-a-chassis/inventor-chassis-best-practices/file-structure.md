# File Structure

## Creating the File Structure

First we need to make a new `Folder` in our `CAD` directory.  For this tutorial, I'm going to use Bingus as the name of the robot.&#x20;

Within this folder, we will create folders for each subsystem on our robot.  In the image below there is a folder for the chassis, claw and lift.  In these folders will go any cut parts for that subsystem and subassembly files for that subsystem.&#x20;

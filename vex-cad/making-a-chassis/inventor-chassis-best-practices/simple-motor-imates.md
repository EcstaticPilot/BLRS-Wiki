# Simple Motor iMates

When you left click any electronic file, you will see white circles on them.  These are called iMates, and they're presets for insert constraints.  Using iMates makes it possible to replace simple electronics with the VEX electronic files. 

## Using iMates

Place a simple motor from `Electronics/V5 Simple Motor.ipt`. 

We will use an insert constraint to constrain the simple motor to our drive channel.  First left click the motor so the iMates show, then insert constrain to one of the iMates \(white circles\).

For the second selection, select the c-channel hole you want.

For the second constraint we will use another insert constraint with the remainder iMate.

The simple motor is constrained with iMates!

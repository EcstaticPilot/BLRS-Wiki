# Inventor Chassis: The Basics

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: You must have installed Autodesk Inventor before continuing!
{% endhint %}

In this tutorial, you will be making the drive base below.  You'll start by downloading the library, and end with a full drive base!  You'll learn how to set up your file structure, navigate Inventor, ground, constrain, use iParts, and mirror components. 

This tutorial works for VEX CAD's Inventor Library 1.1 and beyond. 

Please look over the [FAQ](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/wiki) if you have any issues!

If you want more assistance, please ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BKV3DJm)!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your CAD will not be identical to the robot you construct.  Screws shift in holes, used spacers become slightly different lengths, parts squish because of screws, etc.  

We suggest using CAD to plan how everything will fit within your robot.  Spacing on moving parts will change between CAD and on your robot.

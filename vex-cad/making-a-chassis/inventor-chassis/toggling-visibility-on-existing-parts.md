# Toggling Visibility on Existing Parts

Sometimes when constraining, there is another part in the way and we can't see what we are doing.  We can toggle visibility on the parts so they aren't seen. 

## Toggle in Workspace

Right click the part in the workspace and select `Visibility`.  This turns visibility off, and the part won't be seen.  The keyboard shortcut for this is `alt+v`.

In the model browser on the left, the part now appears grayed out.  You can bring it back by either right clicking and selecting `Visibility`, or selecting the part and pressing `alt+v` on your keyboard.

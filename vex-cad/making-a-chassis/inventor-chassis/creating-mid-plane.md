# Creating Mid-Plane

## Creating Mid-Plane

Before mirroring the half of the drive we've created, we need to create a mid-plane.

Make sure you're in the `Assemble` tab in the ribbon.  Select the drop down for `Plane`, and select `Offset from Plane`.&#x20;

Now select the thickness of the cross brace. &#x20;

The cross brace I chose was 35 holes long.  Each hold is 0.5", so this c-channel is 17.5" long.  I have the plane coming in `-(17.5/2)` to put a mid-plane in the center of the cross brace.  Once this is done, click the green check mark.&#x20;

If completed correctly, you should have an orange plane in the center of your cross brace.&#x20;

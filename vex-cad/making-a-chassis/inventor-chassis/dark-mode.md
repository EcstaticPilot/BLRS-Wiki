# Dark Mode

Dark mode is a personal preference to make software less straining on your eyes.  This is optional, but for this tutorial I will be using dark mode with a gradient background.&#x20;

## Enabling Dark Mode

In the top left of your screen, go to `File` then `Options` at the bottom.&#x20;

Go to `Colors` at the top, then make sure your `UI Theme` is `Dark (pre-release)` and the `In-canvas Color Scheme` is `Dark`.  For `Background`, make sure it's on `1 Color`.  This is the Inventor dark mode!

### Background Gradient

I prefer a gradient in the background, with white fading into black.  To enable that, set your `Background` to `Gradient`.  Then go to `Customize Schemes`.&#x20;

Click the `+` next to `Background`.  My `Top Screen` RGB is `255 255 255`, and my `Bottom Screen` RGB is `12 12 12`.&#x20;

Press `Okay` then `Apply`, and you're all done!

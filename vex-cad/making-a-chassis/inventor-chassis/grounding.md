# Grounding

If you select (left click) your cross brace and drag your mouse, you can move your part around.  In the next article, we are going to constrain everything to this cross brace.  If it can move around, our robot can move around!&#x20;

## Grounding your Cross Brace

To ground the cross brace, left click the cross brace to select it.  Right click, then select `Grounded`.

After the part is grounded, you should see a lock next to your mouse when you hover over the part.&#x20;

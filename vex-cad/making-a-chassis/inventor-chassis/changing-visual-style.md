{% hint style="info" %}
This is a personal preference!  We find that Shaded with Edges makes it a little easier to see the edges of your parts, but what you use is your choice!  The remainder of this tutorial will use Shaded with Edges.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Changing View

In the ribbon, select `View` and go to `Visual Style`.  The default view is `Shaded`.  Select `Shaded with Edges`. &#x20;

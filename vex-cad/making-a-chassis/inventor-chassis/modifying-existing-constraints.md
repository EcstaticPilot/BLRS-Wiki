# Modifying Existing Constraints

Let's say you've constrained this 2x to the 5x, but now you want to mount the 2x on a spacer.  We could constrain a spacer to the 5x, then the 2x to the spacer.  That's bad practice, and there's a nicer way of doing it. 

## Modifying Insert Constraint

The insert constraint brings two faces together and keeps them concentric.  How close the faces are to each other is a parameter within the constraint. 

On the left of our screen is our model browser.  If we click the `Relationships` folder, we can select the constraint we want to modify.  By typing`0.5` here and pressing `Enter` on our keyboards.

If done correctly, the 2x will now be 0.5" away from the 5x.

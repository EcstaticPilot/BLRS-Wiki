# Spacers Cont.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This method of using iParts only works in Inventor Library 1.3 and beyond!  If you're on 1.1 or 1.2, please use the previous article for iParts!
{% endhint %}

## Alternate Way to Get iParts

Instead of placing the `Spacer (Nylon, .500 OD.ipt` and selecting through the iPart window, you can find the part in the `Spacer (Nylon), .500 OD` folder. 

![Spacers Folder](../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28125%29.png)

 For this part, we need 0.5" length spacers.  Then place as normal with `Open`.

This spacer will get constrained in the gap between the 2x and 5x.

Remember to save your file with `ctrl+s`!

If completed correctly, your drive should look like this.

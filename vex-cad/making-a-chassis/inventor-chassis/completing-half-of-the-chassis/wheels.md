# Wheels

## Wheels

First we need to place them.  We can find them in `Motion/Wheels/Omnis/4 Omni, square.ipt`.  `Square` means it has a square insert in the wheel.  

We will use one insert constraint from the inner drive channel, and that's the only constraint we need.  The reason we use two on structure is to stop it from rotating, but this is a wheel and it's okay if it rotates, so one constraint is okay.

We will use the insert parameter to set the wheel a distance away from the inner drive c-channel.  My offset is 0.3125" because it's the same as a 0.25" spacer with two washers.

After placing a wheel on the back, it should look like this.

# Inner Drive Channel

Reference the inventor basics connecting two c-channels tutorial if you need more clarity. 

{% page-ref page="../connecting-two-c-channels.md" %}

## Inner Drive Channel

This gets constrained with the same constraints we used for the outer drive channel, one insert and one mate constraint.  Except now that we know about constraint parameters, we are going to offset the insert constraint by 0.5" before pressing `Apply`.

After adding the mate constraint to another hole, this inner drive channel is fully constrained!

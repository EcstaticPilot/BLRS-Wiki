# Installation

Woo! You've downloaded Autodesk Inventor and the [VEX CAD Inventor Library](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest) and you're ready to learn how to use it!

Without a consistent file structure, any attempt at CAD collaboration will cause conflicts and missing parts.

## Creating the File Structure

We recommend creating a new folder called `CAD` in your `Documents` folder on your computer. In the `CAD` folder, place the most [recent version of the Library found here](https://github.com/VEX-CAD/VEX-CAD-Inventor/releases/latest).&#x20;

Every new robot that you want to CAD, you'll make a new folder here with the name of your robot. When collaborating CAD with your teammates, you will send the **robot folder** back and forward.



When done, your file structure should look like this:

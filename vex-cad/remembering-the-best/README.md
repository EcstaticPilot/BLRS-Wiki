# Remembering The Best

Remembering The Best is an open-source project started by Zach (929u) in 2019 as a way to share and appreciate the hard work that went into iconic robots in Vex. The goal was to share each team's work and educate members of the Vex community on different designs and building techniques.&#x20;

Each of the robots featured is well known for their design, and performance during their respective season. To commemorate this, contributors to this project create detailed (and accurate) CAD models from photos and videos of the robots in order to share them. Each robot is shared as a .STEP file and is accompanied by some renders. STEP files can be viewed in most CAD programs (We recommend  Inventor, Fusion 360, Solid Works, Blender, or Onshape) by downloading the file and following steps in the program.

**We recommend opening the Code Pens for each robot in a new tab to view it in full screen.** **They are the largest they can be on this website and are viewable in all browsers, but they may appear small. If you click the \*.5\* button on the bottom, it may work better as well.**

Many people have contributed to this project since it's start. Each contributor is credited next to the robot that they modeled, and the photos that they rendered. If you would like to contribute to the project, please reach out to Max Johnson (91A, BLRS) at `mhjohnso@purdue.edu` so that he can help you get started and share your model here.

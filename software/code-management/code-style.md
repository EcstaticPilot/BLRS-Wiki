## What is code style?

This is why having good code style for your robots is important. Being able to easily understand and read the code makes it easier to iterate and make your code better. Otherwise, you'll spend lots of time figuring out what your teammates and your past-self had written.&#x20;

1. Your code style is consistent across your project(s)

# Test and Refine

**With the completed design or solution, testing is now required to make sure it works. When testing, recording both qualitative data, such as whether or not the robot can score, and quantitative data, such as whether the robot functions consistently, helps to recognize any failure points or inconsistencies to refine. Ideally, repeat this step until every recorded data-point is optimal.**

This step designates an experiment to test whether or not your bot is capable of doing what it is asked. Through the entire process of building a working robot, the EDP should be repeated multiple times, and this step may be repeated as necessary.

In doing an experiment, the outcome must be quantifiable where it be qualitative or quantitative. This can range anywhere from simply whether the drivetrain moves or not to how fast the drivetrain should travel based on linear speed vs. how fast it actually travels.

Manipulating your variables, each outcome should be recorded to ultimately be analyzed. This data should be as stated previously, qualitative and quantitative. Through each part of the experiment, everything should be accounted for in detail. _Trials should be ran multiple times to assure precision._&#x20;

Once the data is accounted for, it can be analyzed to state that the bot works or it needs work. If it works, it can be be further perfected or set to practice & compete. If the bot needs works, it should be sent through further optimization and repeat the Engineering Design Process to get competition ready.

To document experiments, graphs, charts, and tables may be made to communicate results in your notebook.
